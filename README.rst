Levis: Programming by the Seat of Your Genes

A toolkit for genetic algorithms in Python, written as a companion to a
technical talk.


Overview
--------
The ``levis`` package contains a collection of genetic traits meant
to be composed to achieve a desired algorithm behavior.

To implement your own GA, you will probably want to extend from one of the
classes in ``selection`` and one of the classes in ``logger``. The former will
give you proportionate or tournament selection, and the latter will enable
logging (including verbosity).

You'll also want to override the ``crossover()`` and ``mutate()`` methods with
implementations from the packages by the same name.

The examples each have three components: a genetic solution, a method to
generate data, and a ``main`` method to wire in command line arguments. The
examples will respond to a ``-h`` flag to display help.


Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of levis' design goals is to be runnable on the default Mac OS Python
installation. As a result, levis targets Python 2.7+ and 3.2+. There are no
dependencies to work with levis, but image rendering in the examples, when
implemented, relies on ``svgwrite``, and some data generation needs ``Faker``.
::

  $ pip install svgwrite
  $ pip install fake-factory


Installing
~~~~~~~~~~
Install by cloning the git repository. Installation via PyPI is coming soon.
::

  $ git clone https://github.com/rawg/levis


Running Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're looking at this project, you're probably more interested in the
example implementations than in the core genetic behaviors. Each ``*.py`` file
in  the ``examples/`` folder should respond to a ``-h`` argument to list its
options. All should run without any options, but you'll want to tweak the
parameters to better understand each algorithm.
::

  $ cd examples/
  $ python knapsack01.py -h
  $ python knapsack01.py --iterations=10 --population-size=5


Testing
-------

Running the Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run all tests:
::

  $ python all_tests.py

If you wish to run individual tests, you'd best know PEP 328 inside and out!

Running an individual test method:
::

  $ python -m tests.test_behavior FinishWhenSlowGATestCase.test_doesnt_finish_when_fast

Running a single test case:
::

  $ python -m tests.test_behavior FinishWhenSlowGATestCase

Running a single test file:
::

  $ python -m tests.test_behavior


Testing Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code is run through ``pylint``, if that sort of thing interests you. Note
that many pylint warnings are currently ignored, but it's good to know your
faults.


Future Items
------------

- [ ] Cycle crossover
- [ ] Merge crossover
- [ ] Explicit "cut-and-splice" crossover (use n-point in the meantime)
- [ ] Remove dependence on ``future`` if possible
