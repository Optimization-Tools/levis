"""Selection strategies for genetic algorithms.

Included is an implementation of a fitness proportionate strategy as well as
tournament selection.

ProportionateGA
  Proportionate selection scores all chromosomes in each generation and gives
  more fit chromosomes an advantage in selection for reproduction that is
  proportionate to the fitness scores. For instance, a chromosome with a score
  of 10 will be twice as likely to be selected as one with a score of 5.

  With proportionate selection comes the advantages of convergence in fewer
  generations and elitism, ensuring the best members of a generation live on
  unchanged to the next.

ScalingProportionateGA
  This is proportionate selection, but one that scales the reproductive
  advantage by using the minimum non-zero score as the lower end of a scale. If
  the highest score in a generation is 100 and the lowest is 30, then scores
  will be scaled from 1 to 70 to increase the advantage of more fit
  individuals.

TournamentGA
  Tournament selection scores a random sample of the population and always
  promotes the member with the best score for reproduction. Elitism is moot,
  since there is no guarantee that the highest scored members of a generation
  are the most fit, but convergence can come in fewer CPU cycles when the
  fitness function is expensive, and it has the advantage of being agnostic to
  the scale of scores.
